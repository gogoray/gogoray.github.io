The lower back lifts the ribs away from the pelvis to keep the lower spine as long as possible.  The base of the palms are pressed firmly against the soles (or heels) of the feet and the fingers are pointed toward the toes.  The arms are extended straight and are turned slightly outward at the shoulder joint so the elbow creases face forward without squeezing the shoulder blades together.  The neck is in a relatively neutral position, neither flexed nor extended, or (for the advanced practitioners only) the head drops back.  Be careful not to strain your neck and harden your throat.  The gaze is either toward the sky or toward the earth, depending upon your flexibility.",

The legs are extended back and the tops of the feet are squared to the earth.  The palms are flat and the fingers are in line with the shoulder blades, or, if possible, the palms are tucked under the shoulders with the elbows bent and tucked into the sides of the body.  On an inhalation, the arms are straightened slightly, maintaining a soft bend in the elbows as the chest lifts off the earth.  Lift up only to the height that is comfortable and that also maintains the pubis and the legs pressed to the earth.  Work the opposing forces by pressing the tailbone toward the pubis as the pubis lifts toward the navel.  The hip points are narrowed.  The buttocks are firm but not hardened.  The shoulder blades are firm against the back.  The side ribs expand to facilitate the backbend.  Lift through the top of the sternum but avoid pushing the front ribs forward, which only hardens the lower back.  Distribute the backbend evenly throughout the entire spine.  The gaze is out in front or straight ahead depending on flexibility.",

The index and middle fingers of each hand are wrapped between the big toes and the second toes.  Fingers and thumbs are curled around and under the big toes to firmly secure the wrap.  The toes press down against the fingers.  To fold deeper into the pose the sitting bones are lifted up toward the sky, the torso is pressed toward the thighs and the crown of the head is lowered toward the earth.  Depending on flexibility, the lower back hollows to a greater or lesser degree.  At the same time, without compressing the back of the neck, the sternum is lifted.  The forehead stays relaxed.  For the full extension of the pose the elbows bend out to the sides as the toes are pulled up.  This lengthens the front and sides of the torso.  For very long hamstrings, draw the forehead toward the shins.  For hamstrings that are short, it is better to focus on keeping the front torso long.  The gaze is down or toward the body.",

The weight of the body is supported mostly by the standing leg while the bottom hand has very little weight on it but is used intelligently to regulate balance.  The upper torso is rotated open to the sky.  Both hips are externally rotated.  Energy is extended actively through the flexed toes to keep the raised leg strong.  The inner ankle of the standing foot is lifted strongly upward, as if drawing energy from the earth.  The sacrum and scapulae are firmly pressed against the back torso and lengthen the coccyx toward the raised foot.  The gaze is either up or down, depending on the condition of the neck.

The shoulder blades are squeezed together.  The weight of the body is supported mostly by the standing leg while the bottom hand has very little weight on it but is used perceptively to maintain balance.  The upper torso is rotated open to the sky.  Both hips are externally rotated.  Energy is extended actively through the flexed toes to keep the raised leg strong.  The inner ankle of the standing foot is lifted strongly upward, as if drawing energy from the earth.  The sacrum and scapulae are firmly pressed against the back torso and lengthen the coccyx toward the raised leg.  The gaze is either up or down, depending on the condition of the neck.  If the neck is injured, the gaze is down.",

The opposite foot is then clasped with both hands and lifted up by pulling the knee in toward the chest.  Fingers are interlaced under the sole of the foot, specifically at the arch.  Avoid placing the thumbs on the tops of the feet.  The standing leg is straight, but the knee joint is not locked.  The standing foot is rooted firmly into the earth while the weight is shifted slightly forward, closer to the ball of the foot, not the heel.  The bent knee then extends straight until it is parallel with the earth.  Maintain balance in the pose with good pranayama (breath work) and Bandhas.  Keep a leveled pelvis.  It is helpful to think about extending the foot up rather than out.  Continue to lengthen the spine from the neck down to the tailbone.  Allow the shoulders to fall into their natural position away from the ears and extend the arms, maintaining the grip on the foot and straightening the leg.  Engage the muscles of the thigh for more stability.  To achieve the full extension of the pose, round the spine and drop the elbows while lowering the head to your knee.  Avoid dropping the abdominals onto your thigh.  Pull the navel up and into the spine while folding forward.  Lower the head to the knee and tuck the chin into the chest into Jalandhara bandha.  This will extend the stretch of the spine up through the neck.  The gaze is toward the knee or out in front.",

The front knee is bent in a 90-degree angle and tracks the front ankle.  The back leg is straight with most of the body's weight pressed into the outside edge of the back foot gripping the earth.  From the center of the back, between the shoulder blades, the arms move away from the torso that is rotated up toward the sky.  One arm is actively reaching up and the other actively reaching down utilizing the fingers tips or flat palm only as a un-weighted balancing tool.  The elbow of the bottom hand is either on the inside or the outside of the bent front knee, depending on the degree of flexibility available.  Beginning students should keep their head in a neutral position, looking straight forward, or turn it to look down and protect the neck.  More experienced students can turn the head and gaze up at the top thumb.",

At the same time, reach the top arm and hand up and overhead extending in a straight line toward the front.  To take the bind then wrap the top arm around and under the backside of the torso and grasp the bottom hand at the wrist if possible.  Minimize lateral flexion of the spine while rotating the torso open.  Press the elbow and the shoulder against the bent knee in an isometric contraction to keep the knee aligned and leverage the rotation of the torso.  The gaze is to upper fingertips and the neck is relaxed.  As all twists lengthen and soften the belly, extend the spine with each inhalation, and increase the twist as you exhale.",
